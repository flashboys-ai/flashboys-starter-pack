## Building Your Prompt Collection

Prompting is the most important skill when it comes to Generative AI. Finding the right tools and AI models is important, but it's not always about which tool you use. It's about how you use it. There are thousands of guides already out there on prompting, so we'll keep this guide short and to the point.

**Stick to these 5 guidelines when AI prompting:**

1. Tell it your goal
2. Be clear and specific
3. Give it a vibe or role
4. Split big asks into small ones
5. Look for signs of hallucination

> Tell it your goal

Whether you are writing a document, building an app, generating an image, generating video, or generating voice... Telling the chatbot what you want is a good place to start.

> Be clear and specific

The more clear and specific you are, the better it is for you to get the output you want.

> Give it a vibe or role

Get creative. You should give the AI a persona or style to model. This can also include a text file, image, or existing app for the AI to riff of.

> Split big asks into small ones

When working on larger projects, you will need many generations. Breaking down large tasks or larger prompts into smaller, more manageable tasks will make things a lot easier.

> Look for signs of hallucination

AI hallucination is when an AI makes an error for whatever reason. Look for signs of this and improve your prompt to enhance the desired output.

Let's see an example of the guidelines in use:

> You are my new prompting expert\
> Give me 3 of your best prompting tips\
> Use your tips and give me 1 example\
> Write it out in the style of a humanoid

Each line can be split into a single prompt for more control.

You will see this example used inside the `openai-api-quickstart.py` script.
